1. Chada Tech and community sponsor Airgead Banking are working together to provide an engaging curriculum for nearby high schools. The program's objectives are to impart financial responsibility and investment ideas to kids. Compound interest and its power will be the project's main topics. Users will be able to monitor the progress of their investments over time with this application. The application's functional requirements, which Airgead Banking has supplied, will aid customers in understanding the potential returns on their investments.

2. I felt that I performed especially well on this assignment in terms of organizing and carrying out my code. Before I started to code anything, I wrote down how I could make it work in my notes. Additionally, I felt that I did a decent job of coding sequentially so that, upon completion of the project, I wouldn't encounter an overwhelming number of various faults that I would have to fix all at once.
   
3. I believe I could improve my code by perhaps using switch statements in place of every if expression. Additionally, the code appeared to be longer than needed.
   
4. The project, in my opinion, was difficult, just like all the other assignments in this semester. To make ends meet, I had to spend a ton of time researching. I don't think I will ever stop studying in my field; I am still learning.
   
5. I believe that this project improved my knowledge of functions and the combination of several functions. I am aware that functions are an essential component of programming, so I believe this knowledge will carry over to future projects and classes.
   
6. I made every effort to preserve my code as close to industry standards as possible in order to keep the software readable, flexible, and manageable. This entails aiming to avoid unnecessary code, adhering to correct coding rules, and maintaining a clean aesthetic.
